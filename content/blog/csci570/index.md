I would like to share my learning experience from **CSCI-570 (Analysis of
Algorithms)** at University of Southern California (USC).

I have started my computer science graduate program at USC this summer (Summer
2021 semester), and CSCI-570 was the first course that I took.

## Course Overview

The course was instructed by professor **Shahriar Shamsian**, and mainly focused
on developing an understanding for the major algortihm design techniques, not
"coding" skills.

Students are expected to have a basic notion of algorithms and data structures
before taking this course.

For course materials, the class relied mostly on the textbook **Algorithm
Design** (by Jon Kleinberg and Ã‰va Tardos) with additional materials provided
during class.

During the course, topics covered include <u>stable matching</u>, <u>greedy
method</u>, <u>divide and conquer</u>, <u>dynamic programming</u>, <u>network
flow</u>, <u>NP-completeness</u>, <u>approximation algorithms</u>, and <u>linear
programming</u>. Additionally, <u>heap</u> data structures (binary heap,
binomial heap, and fibonacci heap) were covered during class.

There were assignments, which do not contribute to the overall grade, after each
major topic. You are expected to get feedback for each assignment that you have
submitted from TAs. These assigments included problems to confirm your
understanding of the topics.

## What I Liked

I really liked the teaching style of professor Shahriar Shamsian. The professor
is very communicative and gives an in-depth explanation for complex topics with
simple wording.

Also, the discussion problems, which we go over after every major topic, include
examples of algorithm usage in solving industry problems. These problems are
moderately difficult, yet interesting.

## Review

I had a great learning experience from this course. While the course is
moderately difficult and time consuming, you will learn various interesting
topics and algorithm usage in practical situations.

If I could suggest one thing for the course, I wish there were some coding
assigments, in order to check my understanding of the actual implementation of
the algorithms. I believe that this kind of training will better help understand
the algorithm and give the opportunity to further optimize a given solution.

Lastly, for student who will be taking this course, I recommend reading the
textbook in-depth in order to understand the core concepts of each topic, and I
advice you to ask many questions to clarify how things work durring class or
office hours.
