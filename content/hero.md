I am a MS student in Computer Science at _*University of Southern California*_.
Currently, I am focusing on _*Operating Systems*_ and _*Software Security*_.

My ultimate goal is to produce positive changes in the world through
computational approaches, and I wish to introduce new insights in solving future
problems.

If you happen to speak Korean, my Korean name is 박정민 (Park Jung Min).
