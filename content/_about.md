Hi! 안녕하세요! I'm **David**, a graduate student living in Los Angeles,
California.

My short term goal is to **learn firm knowledge in the computer science area and
related disciplines**, and to **cultivate research skills**. My long term
objective is to become an **innovative researcher** and a **good teacher**.

After borned in _*Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania*_, I spend my elementary years in
_*Minnesota*_. Then I moved to _*Seoul, Korea*_, and finished my middle and high
school classes and entered the _*College of Science and Technology in Hongik
University, Korea*_. A year later, I served my military duty and returned to
academics, and graduated in 2020.

During my undergraduate studies, I concentrated my exploring in computer
technology both academically and practically. I realized that I was most
interested in **computer systems**. I got more interested in the technical
approach of how computer systems were designed such as operating systems and
cloud systems. As a result, to gain a better understanding of advanced topics
related to computer systems, I decided to pursue graduate study and now here I
am!

In my free time I enjoy playing table tennis and golf. I also like watching
K-dramas on NetFlix.
