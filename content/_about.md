I'm **David**, a graduate student living in Los Angeles, California. I am a MS
student in Computer Science at [_*University of Southern California*_][usc].

I am interested in _*Operating Systems*_, _*Computer Networking*_, and
_*Software Security*_.

My ultimate goal is to produce positive changes in the world through
computational approaches, and I wish to introduce new insights in solving future
problems.
